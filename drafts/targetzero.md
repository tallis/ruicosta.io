-------------------------

## Transportation accounts only for 16% of global CO2 missions.

Only? Wow. This is was 1 of the **20** the surprising facts I've learned while reading Bill Gates latest, "How to avoid a climate disaster".

I bought the book a bit by accident while browsing a local bookshop for something to read during my time off work. Climate change is not new. Overall we've been reading and feeling more of the effects caused by, yet not exclusively, the amount of greenhouse effects we emit to the atmosphere.

While driving to my destination, feeling the heat of this 2021 warmest day so far, I was sensitive to the argument that many things need to change. And I was expecting to some *captain-obvious* advises on things we (*pluralis majestatis*) had to change. Avoid unnecessary waste, invest in carbon-neutral products, prioritize clean energy, eat less meat, buy electric cars, walk more - *Wash me with the all climate-conscious decisions we need to adopt before it's too late!*. I was ready.

Or so I thought. 

A few pages into the book I realised that I was loaded with misconceptions and misinformation. 

Here, I'll share with you some easy-to-digest facts that changed my mind and some extra digging I did afterwards. Let's go:

##### The best solar panels today convert only 25% of sunlight that hits them into electricity.

Ok, but technology will evolve, and I'm sure we can do better. "The theoretical limit is ~33%"- the so called [Sockley-Queisser limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley%E2%80%93Queisser_limit).

**Covid-19 pandemic resulted only in ~5% reduction of greenhouse gases emissions in 2020 **

-43.5% passenger flights YoY (January 2021) and BBC reporting early results showing carbon monoxide from New York cars reducing by ~50% compared to 2019. The tragic consequences of the pandemic had a silverlining. Not enough. Especially if we remember that after 2008's global financial crash, carbon emissions increased **5%** from the additional fossil fuel use.
