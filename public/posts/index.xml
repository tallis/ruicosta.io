<p>On the <strong>personal side</strong>, it was a transformative year where past-frustrations led to accelerated personal growth.</p>
<p>Naturally, that didn’t happen out of the blue. A mixture of coaching, personal experiences, and countless hours of thinking allowed me to distil the following…</p>

<h2 id="5-lessons-about-effective-communication-and-personal-growth"><strong>5 lessons about effective communication and personal growth</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1) Building for sustainable growth, both personal and professional, consists of designing every single action to replicable, atomic, and strictly necessary.</strong></p>
<p>Buckling up as many tasks in parallel as possible, led me to assume I was optimizing for <em>SPEED</em>.</p>
<p>Speeding things down helped me to take the necessary steps and freeing up enough time to think, and absorb, the <strong>WHY, HOW,</strong> and <strong>WHAT</strong> of my actions.</p>
<p><strong>2) Communicating effectively is made out of repeating multiple times and getting others to repeat it back. *Again, communicating effectively is made out of repeating multiple times and getting others to repeat it back.*</strong></p>
<p>Having a fast-paced type of living, led me to assume that saying things once would give people the necessary understanding of what I was trying to communicate.</p>
<p>Confirming that I communicated clearly helped me to keep moving with the right foundations and context in place.</p>
<p><strong>3) Defining goals that are not specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and limited in time augments the probability achievement failure.</strong></p>
<p>Setting clunky and poorly planned, yet oddly ambitious, goals, led me to assume that all necessary steps were predicted.</p>
<p>Thinking thoroughly every single step of the way of a journey towards a goal, helped me to start delivering on the path I was setting myself to cross.</p>
<p><strong>4) Silence opens space for observation and understanding.</strong></p>
<p>Trying to rush reactions and quickly share my point of view, led me to block important time that was necessary for absorbing what was just shared.</p>
<p>Enjoying the silence in a conversation, helped me to think how what was just shared resonated with me and sharply and bluntly formulate my point of view.</p>
<p><strong>5) Deeming one’s action as adequate or not is heavily dependent on the level of context we provide.</strong></p>
<p>Assuming everyone had the necessary context when performing an action, led me to interpret things differently than it was intended by the first person.</p>
<p>Containing myself from reacting and confirming the <strong>WHY, HOW,</strong> and <strong>WHAT</strong> of one’s actions helped me guide myself towards the necessary context that was given, or that was still in need to be provided.</p>
<p>These lessons helped me understand that in most of my actions**, speed is achieved not by speeding things up but by slowing down and taking the necessary time for every single action to be performed**.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is more to life than simply increasing its speed.”
― Mahatma Gandhi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2016 was quite an intense year.</p>
<p>I learned that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting goals is as important as configuring ourselves to be committed to achieving them;</li>
<li>Reducing the number of unattainable and poorly-designed goals takes time and discipline;</li>
<li>Letting ourselves down and frustrated for not achieving our goals should help us improve our systems and not dropping them by design.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s how I started managing my goals, personal communication, and growth in 2017.</p>
<p>For me, building systems, processes, and routines around the idea that we can become a better version of ourselves comes down to the understanding that such are designed by us, the only stakeholder for setting the direction that keeps us moving forward.</p>
