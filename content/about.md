You’ve guessed the name from the website link.

Most of my day is spent around technology.

I’ve dedicated most of my career to building a platform that enables the Internet of Moving Things. Our goal is to enable devices, for now mostly vehicles, to connect to each other and the Internet. This mesh network allows us to have more resilient wireless Internet access to the services surrounding us and enable new ways to live our lives. 

Our biggest challenge over the next years will be climate change.

>By decentralizing and distributing the way “moving things” connect, we will be able to build new products that put the environment first and power how we, as human beings, adapt to the world that is yet to come.

My second obsession is education. 

More specifically, the challenge of making education available to everyone, independent of their language or social setting. I’ve dedicated some years early in my life to building a platform to do so. We’ve reached 100,000+ students globally, with educational content made in 8 different languages, including Kurdish, Bangla, Polish, Greek, Urdu, and others. Yet, I feel that my mission there is not completed.

The views here are my own. 

This is a tiny corner that I'll use mostly to play with new tech and spark off my desire to write what I mostly distill in thoughts.
