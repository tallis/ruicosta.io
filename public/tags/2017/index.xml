Highlights — non-exhaustive
A series of Portuguese endeavors out in the stars (Euro cup, UN leadership, Portugal as a startup nation); A thousand-year-old broken-unity taking new steps; A joyful environmental and safety positive impact by the increasing rollout electrically powered and assisted-driving vehicles. Lowlights — even less exhaustive
The increasing number of refugees; The almost cartoonish U.S. election result; The series of music stars leaving us ahead of time.</description></item></channel></rss>
